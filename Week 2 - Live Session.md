- How to measure how well the model works
	- Check similarity (rouge)
	- Human in the loop
	- If the model has never been trained on a chocolate chip recipe, will it be able to make that recipe
	- Have agent models evaluate the model
		- One likes Cakey cookies, another likes crispy, and they all score the model
		- Voting scheme to scale the votes of each of the agents
	- Models that are trained to generate an embedding for a whole sentence. The whole recipe. Just that ingredient. 
		- Getting a fuzzier match, doesn't need to be "cookie" can be "biscuit"
	- Not simple like a math problem, many right answers

	- Pretty quickly the transformer models were doing better than the humans because the model was jumbling words
