- Ask meaningful questions
- Know how to find out more
- Read and understand current research papers

# Weekly News

- NEW type of model: SLM - Small Language Model
	- Able to run it on all types of machines, much more accessible than something like ChatGPT (LLM) which takes a significant amount of hardware
	- These small models (in green) are outperforming some of the LLMs
	- Microsoft is claiming that this model will run on your iPhone - actually doing the computation on your phone

# Introduction to Generative AI
## Why are we even talking about Gen AI?
- In 2021 we weren't talking about it at all even though most of this existed
- A confluence of events:
	- Recent developments in NLP allow for generation of flawless language
		- Transformers and neural architectures
		- Self supervised training
		- Internet scale data - huge amounts of data compared to original models of 7 novels and wikipedia
	- Recent developments allow for generation of photorealistic images not conditioned by text input
		- Say in text what you want an image to be
	- Hundreds of millions of people started using chatGPT within 2 months for a wide variety of applications
	- New models are being released on a weekly basis. Many different companies producing these models
- Gen AI Models are Very Capable

	- Image generated by Gen AI - Jason Allen spend 80 hours working on Mid journey prompt 
- Not Capable
	- ![](Pasted%20image%2020240503162403.png)
	- Models are continuing to be refined to avoid mistakes like this

## What do we mean by Generative?
- Generative
	- ![](Pasted%20image%2020240503162905.png)
	- Using new tools and techniques:
		- Vector and Matrix representations
		- Transformers
		- Self-supervised learning techniques
		- Digital content for training
		- Hardware (GPU, TPU, etc.)
	- We can *generate* a wide variety of novel outputs having learned distributions
	- 'Generative' because the model is generating some novel output (conditioned on the input)
		- Input helps the mould the probability space
		- Output is generated one token at a time (for text)

## What is 'Artificial Intelligence'?
- Gen AI models product some amazing outputs
	- Appear to demonstrate 'intelligence'
- Artificial intelligence is what we label such behavior in computers
- Intelligence
	- No definition.....
	- Different diciplines have different ideas of the definition
		- ![](Pasted%20image%2020240503164449.png)
	- Why are we calling these LLMs intelligent?
		- They seem to understand us
		- Respond rationally
		- follow directions
		- preform new tasks
		- generate novel outputs
	- Anthropomorphic Projection onto LLMs
	- Neural net consists of neurons like the brain
		- Clever Hans problem?
	- 

## Beyond Evaluation (safety and ethical issues)?
