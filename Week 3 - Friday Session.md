- New models cover all 3!!!

How did NLP get so good?
- GPUs
- an Internets worth of data
- focus on the right problems
- Applicable language based questions to solve

- Take the documents and represent the chunks of text as vectors instead of key word searching
	- Store all vectors in the vector database
		- Vector database is a NEW type of database
			- Do the Nearest Neighbor search
	- When you do the search, you see which vector is the most similar
	- Then finds the answer

## Transfer Learning
![](photos/Pasted%20image%2020240517170533.png)
- Won't have enough data to do without transfer learning
1. Train data on unrelated data
2. Initialize with your dataset
3. Start training on new dataset
4. Fine tune
5. Get better results
